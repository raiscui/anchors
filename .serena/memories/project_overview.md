- Rust crate providing incremental/"self-adjusting" computation graph primitives called Anchors (Vars, map, then, etc.).
- Engine allows hybrid Adapton- plus Incremental-style push updates; designed for efficient recomputation via observed nodes.
- Repo has `src` library, `examples` showcasing usage, `benchmarks` under `benches`, and `tests` dir for integration tests.
- Target toolchain: Rust edition 2024 with optional features like `generic_size_voa`, `anchors_slotmap`, `lock_strict` (enabled by default).
- Depends on arena-graph, im-rc, slotmap, smallvec, tracing, emg_common/hasher; uses Criterion + insta for benches/tests.
